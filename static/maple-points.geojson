O'Malley was so taken by Maple's approach that when he was later elected to governor of Maryland, he applied the CompStat-like model he'd helped implement in Baltimore to the entire state's operations. Maple was also instrumental in facilitating the hiring of Bratton-era NYPD alum Edward Norris as Baltimore police commissioner. Norris would go on to be indicted on federal charges of stealing over $20,000 from the city police force. "
